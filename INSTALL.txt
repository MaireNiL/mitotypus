INSTALLING SOMATYPUS 1.0
07/02/2016


Somatypus has been designed as a set of Bash and Python scripts that do not require a real 
installation, but simply adding the software directory to the PATH environment variable, 
thus making set-up straightforward. However, it has some minimal software dependencies:

• Python 2.6 or later (it has not been tested on Python 3.X).
• Platypus (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus), which in turn requires htslib 
  (http://www.htslib.org) — we recommend installing both inside a same directory.
• VCFtools (https://vcftools.github.io), for using the vcf-sort command.
• The tabix package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/tabix), for using the 
  tabix and bgzip commands. It should come together with htslib.



1. INSTALLER SCRIPT

Installing the pipeline is as easy as downloading the latest version’s ZIP file (available 
from the GitHub repository), uncompressing it into the desired location, and running the 
install_somatypus.sh script. 

(Replace the example path with your own.)

    /PATH/TO/somatypus-1.0/install_somatypus.sh
	

This script will automatically download and install any necessary dependencies, and will 
add the somatypus-1.0/src directory (which contains the pipeline scripts) to the PATH 
environment variable. It will stop if it detects any problem at any step of the 
installation. If you are unable to find the cause of the problem, then you should open 
this script and run the commands in it from the terminal, one by one. 

Once the installation process is finished, you will need to source the .profile file in 
your home directory, so that the changes made by the installation script are applied. 
After that, you should be able to run somatypus directly from the command line:

    source ~/.profile
    somatypus


(Just after installing Somatypus, you will be able to run it only from the terminal in 
which you sourced the .profile file. If you need to run Somatypus in other terminal, you 
must either source the .profile file again, or log out of your session and log in again.)



2. USERS WITHOUT ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES

During the installation you will be asked for your password, because administrator 
privileges are needed to complete the installation of some of the dependencies. 

If you do not have administration privileges in your computer (i.e. you cannot do ‘sudo’), 
you will not be able to run the 'make install' commands. Make sure that you run the other
steps of the script in a terminal, but also follow these complementary steps:
	

a) After running 'make' in the installation of htslib, add to your PATH (in the 
   ~/.profile file) the FULL paths of:

somatypus-1.0/Platypus_0.8.1
somatypus-1.0/Platypus_0.8.1/htslib

To do this, you can either edit the ~/.profile file with a text editor (e.g. nano), and 
modify the "export PATH=..." statement as necessary (or create it if it does not exists),
or just go to the 'somatypus-1.0' directory:

    cd /PATH/TO/somatypus-1.0
    
And run this:

    echo "export PATH=$PWD/Platypus_0.8.1:$PWD/Platypus_0.8.1/htslib:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile

Regardless of which option you choose, then you need to source the file by running:

    source ~/.profile


b) After the previous step, move the contents of 
   somatypus-1.0/Platypus_0.8.1/htslib/htslib to somatypus-1.0/Platypus_0.8.1/htslib:
   
    cd /PATH/TO/somatypus-1.0
    mv Platypus_0.8.1/htslib/htslib/* Platypus_0.8.1/htslib/


c) Before running 'buildPlatypus.sh', go to the 'somatypus-1.0' folder (if your are not
   there already):

    cd /PATH/TO/somatypus-1.0
 
And run the following commands:

    export LDFLAGS=-L$PWD/Platypus_0.8.1/htslib
    cp Platypus_0.8.1/htslib/libhts.so.1 Platypus_0.8.1/


d) After running 'make' in the installation of VCFtools, add to your PATH (in the 
   ~/.profile file) the FULL paths of:
   
somatypus-1.0/vcftools-0.1.14/src/cpp
somatypus-1.0/vcftools-0.1.14/src/perl

To do this, you can either edit the ~/.profile file with a text editor (e.g. nano), and 
modify the "export PATH=..." statement as necessary, or just go to the 'somatypus-1.0' 
directory (if you are not there already):

    cd /PATH/TO/somatypus-1.0
    
And run this:

    echo "export PATH=$PWD/vcftools-0.1.14/src/cpp:$PWD/vcftools-0.1.14/src/perl:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile

Regardless of which option you choose, then you need to source the file by running:

    source ~/.profile


* It is possible that these steps will not be enough to complete the installation.
